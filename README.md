# HeavenHR Java Coding Challenge
This project was created as part of the hiring process for the position of Senior Software Engineer in HeavenHR. The main goal is to be able 
to create job offers and create applications for those same offers, along with other very basic statistics. 

# Dependencies
- Java 8 or superior
- Lombok
- Spring 
- H2 
- The project is built using maven. 

# Running  and Testing the application
We are using Maven Wrapper to avoid maven installation. 

1. Run ```$ ./mvnw clean install```
2. Run ```$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run``` 

This will start a web server and the API will be accesible through Http://localhost:8080.
For testing convenience, a postman collection has been created for testing the endpoints, it can be found in the following link: 
[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/d82b4496088c6d6270aa)

Alternatively, you'll be able to access a Swagger page on Http://localhost:8080 to test the endpoints, and of course you can test them 
directly via postman or CURL.

Additionally, the H2 console it's enabled by default and can be accessed on http://localhost:8080/h2-console/ with the following information: 

```Driver Class: org.h2.Driver```
```JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:~/h2/recruitment```
```User Name: sa```
```Password: ```

This values are configurable through the Application.properties file. Be aware, as we are using an in-memory database, all data will be lost
every time the application is restarted.
